<h3>Research Interests</h3>
My research centers on how social identity and categorization processes influence our perceptions of others and the world. I have a broad interest in how cognitive and societal belief systems can shape experiences of threat and anxiety, using methods ranging from behavioral neuroscience to sociology. I am also interested in how uncertainty influences perceptions of motherhood and child-rearing. I am committed to interdisciplinary approaches and hope to contribute to understanding our social identities and group memberships influence behavior.
