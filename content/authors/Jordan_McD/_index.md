<h3>Research Interests</h3>
My current research interests include minority influence, social identity, prejudice, and social and political issues.  I am especially interested in the ways in which  mainstream society appropriates Black people and culture, but attribute both negatively.  With the current socio-political climate, I feel passionately about social change and equality.
