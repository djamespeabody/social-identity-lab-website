<h3>Thesis</h3>
Papal Support for Women Under Uncertainty: Changing Perceptions of Women in Religious Leadership Positions in the Roman Catholic Church.

<h3>Research Interests</h3>
I’m interested in researching stereotype content, prejudice, attitude change, and leadership. In my research, I attempt to merge these interests by examining marginalized groups in a leadership context in an attempt to improve perceptions of their leadership efficacy and support – two elements which are paramount to their success.</p>
