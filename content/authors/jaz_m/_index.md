<h3>Research Interests</h3>
I am interested in examining how criticism of not just the individual, but a group’s leader, might influence individuals’ perception of their social identity and responses to inter-group relations. My thesis specifically examines how an intergroup context affects perceived criticism by polarizing group identities and delegitimizing fair criticism.
