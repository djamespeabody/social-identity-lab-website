title = "HSU Social Identity Lab"

+++

We research the social identity and self-categorization processes which underlie social and political attitudes and behavior. We examine a range of intra and intergroup processes involved in social influence and intergroup relations, including minority influence, extremism, trends toward populism, and support for non-traditional and even authoritarian leadership. Dr. Amber Gaffney leads the Humboldt SI Lab. We also love nature and animals (see pictures of some of our honorary lab members).
