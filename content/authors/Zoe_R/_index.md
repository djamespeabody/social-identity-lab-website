<h3>Research Interests</h3>
My research interests are rooted in the fields of social neuroscience and cognitive psychology. I am interested in investigating how social cohesion in groups influences stress responses and how they can lead to pathological anxieties. I am interested in the neuropsychology of human behavior and social perceptions, particularly understanding how these factors impact vulnerable group members, like pregnant women and children. I also have interests in how uncertainty in one’s social identity influences perceptions of motherhood and child-rearing. I am committed to using interdisciplinary approaches in my research and hope to contribute to community and women’s health policy decisions.
