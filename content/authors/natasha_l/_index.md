<h3>Thesis</h3>
Influenced by the Other: How Uncertainty Affects Minority Influence in Intra and Intergroup Contexts.

<h3>Research Interests</h3>
My research interests are centered around social justice and activism. Having such a general interest allows me to pursue many avenues. My favorite areas are minority influence, social identity theory, group processes, and intergroup relations. Given the current state of our society and communities, a groups based approach is the best method to address the problems that plague our society. As researchers we have access to knowledge that helps to clarify the mess we are in, the fun part is getting to explore that knowledge.
