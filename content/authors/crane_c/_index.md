<h3>Thesis</h3> 
Uncertainty, Populist Deprivation Rhetoric, and Extremism

<h3>Research Interests</h3>
My work is focused on leadership and political polarization. I am interested in how intergroup relations  affect group norms, identity and political extremism. Additionally, I am invested in social justice, and am committed to integrating an understanding of social identity, self categorization, and intergroup behavior to support a lasting shift towards a more just world.
