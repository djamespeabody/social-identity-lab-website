<h3>Research Interests</h3>
As an aspiring physician I am extremely passionate about the holistic health model which has led my research interests to become oriented toward the social aspect of health. I am currently pursuing research related to minority influence, entitativity, uncertainty, intergroup relations and attitude change. I am interested in examining these constructs with respect to attitudes toward social policies that directly affect community health such as abortion access, vaccination requirements, and supervised injection sites. Ultimately, I hope that my work will serve as an illustration of how vital social relations and policies are to comprehensive health on both an individual and societal level.
