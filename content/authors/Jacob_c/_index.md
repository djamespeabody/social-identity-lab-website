<h3>Research Interests</h3>
I am currently interested in Social Psychology research on identity concealment,  uncertainty identity theory, and group influence as they relate to the topics of gender and sexuality. More specifically, I am interested in looking at men's issues and fragile masculinity as it relates to aspects of the LGBTQ+ community and femininity in general. I hope to be able to shed some light on why men in general hold certain attitudes on these topics and what may be done to expose new ideas and ways of thinking to the community
