<h3>Thesis</h3>
Will Work for Belongingness: Prototypicality, Uncertainty, Threat, and Collective Action Willingness

<h3>Research Interests</h3>
I am interested in examining how individuals' feelings of belongingness affects patterns related to intergroup relations in political contexts. I am interested in exploring these constructs through the lenses of social identity theory, self-categorization theory, and uncertainty-identity theory.
