<h3>Research Interests</h3>

I am currently interested in researching humor in its use in persuasion, inclusion, and social identity. I want to ultimately explore how, when discussing
controversial topics, humor can be used to persuade or change a persons way of thinking of an issue. I hope to bring to light information, research, and data that is not often talked about or researched in the world of social psychology.
