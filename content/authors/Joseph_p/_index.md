<h3>Research Interests</h3>
 My research interests include intergroup relations (specifically within the US) with a more progressive take - less focus on minority/majority relations and more focus on minority/other minority relations. This is especially important right now due to hate crimes we see being committed against Asian people by other POC as a result of COVID-19. Additionally, I am interested in cancel culture and how that can affect the discourse/learning environment for college students. Finally, another research interest includes examining academic insularity and how that can disenfranchise marginalized groups, potentially lowering their interest in becoming an academic.
