<h3>Thesis</h3>
Supporting Extremist Governments: The Result of Uncertainty?

<h3>Research Interests</h3>
Currently, my research interests focus on uncertainty, social identity, prejudice, and social and political issues. Given the current socio-political climate, I am interested in the researching the rise of extremist groups such as the Alt-Right, as well as the resurgence of old extremist groups such as the KKK. I have a passion for social change and would love to apply my future work to combating extremism and extremist groups.
