<h3>Thesis</h3>
Endocrinological markers of spatial learning in Zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>)

<h3>Research Interests</h3>
My work is focused on identifying psychobiological indicators in our behaviors. I study predominantly: learning and memory, facial  processing, identity continuity, animal models. and the neurobiology of emotions. My goal is to contribute in building the phenomenological net by concisely bridging competitive theories in cognitive neuroscience.
