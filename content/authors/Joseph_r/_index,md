<h3>Research Interests</h3>
Currently, I am interested in examining the role played by self-uncertainty and social identity in shaping group processes such as political polarization, political extremism, and leadership. Outside of the political sphere of social psychology, I am interested in exploring the relationship between identity uncertainty and risk-taking behavior (namely substance abuse).
