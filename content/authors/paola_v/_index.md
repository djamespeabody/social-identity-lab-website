<h3>Research Interests</h3>
What interests me about social identity is how one's sense of belongingness can define the way a person thinks and behaves within their group and in society at large. Working with the SI Lab, I have learned the positive and negative impacts that a prototypical leader can have and how leaders and group members influence the actions and belief systems of the whole group. Even though my ending goal is to be a Clinical Psychologist, using today's social issues to explain topics such as uncertainty and intergroup relations will help me understand human social behaviors and apply them in my future path. It's important to acknowledge how the "Us vs. them" mentality can be as simple as children playing against each other to something as global and systemic as racism & discrimination..
