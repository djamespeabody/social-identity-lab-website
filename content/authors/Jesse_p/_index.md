<h3>Research Interests</h3>
I am interested in examining how music, when linked to specific social identities, may be used as a political tool. Specifically, I am interested in combining these ideas with work on minority influence. My other research interests include inter/intra-group processes, leadership, uncertainty, and extremism.
