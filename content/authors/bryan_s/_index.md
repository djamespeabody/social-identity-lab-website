Bryan Sherburne is a Ph.D. Student in Mass Communications and Social Psychology at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki and a Lecturer at Humboldt State University.

<h3>Research Interests</h3>
My research interests include examining how fundamental changes to multiple levels of group identity (i.e., superordinate identity change and pressure from distinct group factions) can fundamentally alter people's sense of belonging within their groups and societies. This includes a focus on uncertainty-identity theory, social identity theory, and perceptions of leadership.

<h3>Recent Work</h3>
Sherburne, B., Gaffney, A. M., Hackett, J. D., Rast, D. E., III., & Hohman, Z. P. (2018, April). <i>Effects of new leadership on schismatic intentions</i>. Oral presentation at the annual meeting of the Western Psychological Association, Portland, OR.
