<h3>Thesis</h3>
Weight Loss in Groups:  How Leaders and Uncertainty Influence Weight Loss Intentions.

<h3>Research Interests</h3>
I am interested in social identity, leadership, uncertainty, group identification, and public health.  In my research, I am examining the preference for different forms of prototypical leadership when people experience uncertainty and how this affects weight loss intentions and health behaviors.  With my research I hope to create more effective interventions for a variety of public health issues.
